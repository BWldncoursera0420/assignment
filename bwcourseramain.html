<h1> More about me </h1>
I was born is Zimbabwe, and grew up in Swaziland and South Africa. I had two older sisters and my father loved reptiles, so all of my childhood involved 'bundu bashing' in the African bush looking for snakes and lizards. My father also milked venomous snakes for medical research as a hobby. Mambas, adders & cobras became our 'guard dogs' - we never had anyone break into our house !
